description: I am working on software that allows midi drums to trigger notes,
  melodies, chords, and chord progressions as well as the typical drum notes.
  It's complicated and will take me a long time, as I have already scrapped my
  work and started over several times. Subscribe to my newsletter to hear about
  any updates!
