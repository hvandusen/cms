I helped build the computer /roʊˈdeɪoʊ/, a super computer by Cory Arcangel that plays phone games. It watches the phone and recognizes things on the screen with computer vision, while  AI software tries to figure out how to tap and swipe its way through the game. In April 2021 it premiered at Green Naftali Gallery in the show Century 21, in /roʊˈdeɪoʊ/ *Let's Play: Kim Kardashian Hollywood.*
